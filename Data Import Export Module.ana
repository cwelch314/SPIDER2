Given the limited project count after the "Start Date for CZ Avg" for some zips, it might make more sense to use the average system size by zip code across all time periods, then apply a scaling factor represented by the ratio of SDGE-wide systems sizes after the start date to SDGE-wide system sizes for all time periods.

One reason for this, especially in the residential sector, is that larger homes may tend to install PV sooner, meaning that early on the adoption curve the actual system size may generate more kWh than an AVERAGE home.

Interconnection data, which doesn't include all AC losses so it's a higher AC estimate than a PV system would actually provide. This conversion factor source is being used to maintain consistency with interconnection convention of CEC-MW-AC. See Avg_AC_DC_CZ_Fcast for calculated values.~

Description: Notes:~
1. The "Select Interconn Fields" user input can be updated after clicking on the "Store Interconnect Fields" button, after which the "Store Interconnect Data" button can be pressed. ~
2. All other structural settings, except "Map Interconn to Sectors" can be specified, after which the "Store Interconnect Sectors" button can be pressed.~
3. The final step is to specify the "Map Interconn to Sectors" settings and press the "Store Aggregate PV Data" button.~
4. To prevent the model size from becoming too large, the "Clear Detailed Interconnect Data" should be pressed before saving the model.~
5. This import routine relies on an ODBC connection, which requires the Microsoft Excel Driver. As such, the driver must be installed on a machine trying to import the data. Additionally, the ODBC connection treats the .xlsx file like a database, which may mean that the import scripts will only work with advanced versions of the Analytica software.

Title: Cleared Range Multiplier
Description: If a range is cleared before writing, this specifies how much larger the clear range is compared to the calculated data range. For example, if the data range extends from row 2-100 and the multiplier is 1, then the range cleared will be rows 2-100. If the multiplier is 2, then the range cleared will be 2-199. The multiplier does not affect the number of columns that will be cleared, as that number usually does not change as a function of non-null data values.
