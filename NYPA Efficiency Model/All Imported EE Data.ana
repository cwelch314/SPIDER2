Substantial advantages are realized in calibration and maintenance, but the critical value lies in the accuracy and reliability of the DDC systems. These features can yield operational energy savings of 15% and greater when compared to the conventional pneumatic system. The inherently precise positioning of valves and dampers with EMCS control loops and blocks are responsible for these energy savings. For instance, to realize the energy-savings opportunity offered by VAV fume hoods, an 8:1 turndown ratio of the exhaust airflow is required. Pneumatic airflow systems typically lose accuracy at 25% of their span, resulting in the capability of only a 4:1 turndown ratio. Solid-state DDC systems provide the degree of precise airflow measurement and control that enables the operation of these VAV systems',~

Variable Percent_Not_Complete
Title: Percent Not Complete
Units: Fraction
Description: NOT COMPLETE FACTOR is the percentage of existing equipment that already represents the high-efficiency option. This applies only to retrofit markets. For example, if 30% of current buildings already have connected thermostats, then the not-complete factor for connected thermostats would be 70% (100% - 30%), reflecting that only 70% of the total potential from thermostats remains.

Variable Feasibility1
Title: Feasibility
Units: Fraction
Description: FEASIBILITY FACTOR is the fraction of applicable end use sales for which it is technically feasible to install the efficiency measure. Numbers below 100% reflect engineering or other technical barriers that are likely to preclude the adoption of the measure. The Study Team did not reduce feasibility for economic or behavioral barriers that would affect penetration estimates. Rather, it reflects technical or physical constraints that would make measure adoption impossible or ill-advised, e.g., efficient lighting technology that cannot be used in certain low-temperature applications.

Variable Applicability1
Title: Applicability
Units: Fraction
Description: APPLICABILITY FACTOR is the fraction of the end-use energy sales (from the sales disaggregation) for each building type and year that is attributable to equipment that could be replaced by the high-efficiency measure. For example, for replacing office interior linear fluorescent lighting with a higher efficiency LED technology, the Study Team uses the portion of total office building interior lighting electrical load consumed by linear fluorescent lighting.
