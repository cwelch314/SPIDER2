Constant Std_Demolition_Rate
Title: Standard Demolition Rate
Units: fraction/year
Description: The standard building demolition rate used when building stocks are growing, or when building stocks are decaying but at a slower rate than this standard level of decay. If building stocks are decaying at a faster rate than the standard demolition rate, then the faster rate is used.

Decision BldgStk_Growth_Rates
Title: Building Stock Growth Rates
Units: fraction/year
Description: These are compounding growth rates superimposed on top of the CEC building stock forecasts. A rate of 0% indicates no change from the CEC forecast. A positive (negative) rate implies additional (less) growth relative to the CEC forecast. Note that these rates will lead to compounding growth over time. For example, a 1%/year growth rate will lead to building stocks that are 1% higher than the CEC forecast after 1 year, but after 10 years the building stocks will be 10.5% [=(1+0.01)^10] higher than the CEC forecast.
