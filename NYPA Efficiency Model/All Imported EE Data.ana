'Solid-state sensors and controllers used in DDC systems have considerable energy-efficiency advantages over conventional pneumatic systems. Substantial advantages are realized in calibration and maintenance, but the critical value lies in the accuracy and reliability of the DDC systems. These features can yield operational energy savings of 15% and greater when compared to the conventional pneumatic system. The inherently precise positioning of valves and dampers with EMCS control loops and blocks are responsible for these energy savings. For instance, to realize the energy-savings opportunity offered by VAV fume hoods, an 8:1 turndown ratio of the exhaust airflow is required.
