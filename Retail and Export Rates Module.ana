Decision Flat_Demand_Schedule
Title: Flat Demand Schedule
Description: Specify the flat demand period number associated with each month. For example, if there are two flat demand periods, the first will take a numeric value of 0 and the second will be a 1. For N number of flat demand periods, the period numbers will range from 0 to N-1 (eg, [0,1,2,...,N-1] ). If one of the input cells is not applicable, give it a value of Null (eg, type Null into the cell).~
~
Example: Winter period extends from Oct-Apr and Summer period extends from May-Sep. Let's assign 0 to the winter period and 1 to the summer period. This designation is arbitrary and could have been reversed. However, the values (eg, $/kW) assigned to period0 and period1 in the Flat Demand Rates table should be consistent with this schedule's designation (eg, winter = period0, summer = period1).~

Decision Demand_TOU_Sched
Title: Demand TOU Schedule
Description: Specify the time-of-use demand period number associated with each month, hour, and day type. For example, if there are two TOU demand periods, the first will take a numeric value of 0 and the second will be a 1. For N number of TOU demand periods, the period numbers will range from 0 to N-1 (eg, [0,1,2,...,N-1] ). If one of the input cells is not applicable, give it a value of Null (eg, type Null into the cell).~
~
Example: Winter period extends from Oct-Apr and Summer period extends from May-Sep. On-peak rates are from 4-9pm on weekdays, and all other hours are off-peak. Let's assign: 0 to the winter off-peak period; 1 to the winter on-peak period; 2 to the summer off-peak period; and 3 to the summer on-peak period. This designation is arbitrary and could be changed. However, the values (eg, $/kW) assigned to period0, period1, period2, and period3 in the Demand TOU Rates table should be consistent with this schedule's designation (eg, winter off-peak = period0, winter on-peak = period1, summer off-peak = period2, summer on-peak = period3).~

Decision Energy_TOU_Schedule
Title: Energy TOU Schedule
Description: Specify the time-of-use energy period number associated with each month, hour, and day type. For example, if there are two TOU energy periods, the first will take a numeric value of 0 and the second will be a 1. For N number of TOU energy periods, the period numbers will range from 0 to N-1 (eg, [0,1,2,...,N-1] ). If one of the input cells is not applicable, give it a value of Null (eg, type Null into the cell).~
~
Example: Winter period extends from Oct-Apr and Summer period extends from May-Sep. On-peak rates are from 4-9pm on weekdays, and all other hours are off-peak. Let's assign: 0 to the winter off-peak period; 1 to the winter on-peak period; 2 to the summer off-peak period; and 3 to the summer on-peak period. This designation is arbitrary and could be changed. However, the values (eg, $/kWh) assigned to period0, period1, period2, and period3 in the Energy TOU Rates table should be consistent with this schedule's designation (eg, winter off-peak = period0, winter on-peak = period1, summer off-peak = period2, summer on-peak = period3).~

Decision Flat_Demand_Rates
Title: Flat Demand Rates
Description: Specify the rate attributes associated with each flat demand period and tier. If one of the input cells is not applicable, give it a value of Null (eg, type Null into the cell).~
~
Attributes:~
max (kW) - the maximum kW of demand that will be charged at the given tier's rates.~
rate ($/kW) - the baseline charge (or credit if negative) associated with each kW of demand during the specific flat demand period.~
adj ($/kW) - an adjustment charge (or credit if negative) associated with each kW of demand during the specific flat demand period that is generally in addition to the baseline ['rate ($/kW)'] charge.~
~
If the 'max (kW)' of demand for a given tier is infinite (ie, it has no maximum cap), then the value should be set to Null. The 'max (kW)' attribute should be expressed in cumulative kWs, not incremental. ~
~
To illustrate the input format, let's say a period0 (on-peak) charge of $5/kW applies to the first 10 kW of demand; a $10/kW charge applies to the next 5 kW of demand; and a $15/kW charge applies to all demand above 15 kW. Additionally, the period1 (off-peak) charges are similar but all reduced by $5/kW. In this situation the data would be specified as such:~

Decision Energy_TOU_Rates
Title: Energy TOU Rates
Description: Specify the rate attributes associated with each TOU energy period and tier. If one of the input cells is not applicable, give it a value of Null (eg, type Null into the cell).~
~
Attributes:~
max (kWh/day) - the maximum kWh/day of consumption that will be charged at the given tier's rates.~
rate ($/kW) - the baseline charge (or credit if negative) associated with each kWh of consumption during the specific TOU energy period.~
adj ($/kWh) - an adjustment charge (or credit if negative) associated with each kWh of consumption during the specific TOU energy period that is generally in addition to the baseline ['rate ($/kWh)'] charge.~
~
If the 'max (kWh/day)' of consumption for a given tier is infinite (ie, it has no maximum cap), then the value should be set to Null. The 'max (kWh/day)' attribute should be expressed in cumulative kWh/day, not incremental. For the "max" attribute, you might need to convert monthly maximums (eg, kWh/month) to daily maximums. If that's the case, use 30.4375 days/month (365.25 [avg days/year] / 12 [months/year] = 30.4375 [avg days/month] ) to make that conversion. ~
~
To illustrate the input format, let's say a period0 (on-peak) charge of $0.10/kWh applies to the first 11.5 kWh/day (ie, ~300 kWh/month) of consumption; a $0.14/kWh charge applies to the next 3.3 kWh/day of consumption; and a $0.19/kWh charge applies to all consumption above 14.8 kWh/day (ie, ~450 kWh/month). Additionally, the period1 (off-peak) charges are similar but all reduced by $.03/kWh. In this situation the data would be specified as such:~
~
Energy TOU Rates (period0) ->~
